A. get delivered, idk, based on dykestra's algorithm? Create as many routes as possible that start at the hub and end at the farthest point

BST with each location and distance inbetween then dykstra's

B. Word doc

C. Pandas mayhaps to read the xlsx files? Regardless, they'll need to be read

D. No dictionaries :( 

*E. Need to think of a hash algo could do, dictionary to hash to dictionary (ID: Hash, Hash: values) Could be individualized too. ID: Hash: Address or deadline or etc.? Done without dictionaries because they are not allowed as dictionaries are a hashmap...

*F. Look up based on any, default values for each, return all values. Look up based on ID.

G. Interface: Kivy. Have an initial window that asks for how many packages, change to a listed view with time, speed, miles driven.

H. Easy

I. Hhhhh

J. Determine later

K. Oh I can justify it when it's done


Notes:

special note is only mentioned once so I'm just going to ignore that and hope for the best. <- can't do that, it's in the hashtable
